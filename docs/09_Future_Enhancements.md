# ðŸ“ˆ 09. Future Enhancements ("Wow" Features - Phase 2+)

Once the core digital signage application is stable and functional, consider these potential enhancements to add more value and "wow" factor.

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                                        | Est. Complexity | Key Considerations                                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-Zone Layouts**       | Divide the screen into multiple independent content zones, each with its own playlist or content type.             | High            | Complex layout definition in API, sophisticated rendering logic in app (multiple `PlaylistManager` instances or similar), focus management.   |
| **Advanced Scheduling**      | Schedule different layouts/playlists for specific times of day, days of the week, or date ranges from the backend. | Medium-High     | Backend scheduling logic, TV app needs to fetch and switch to the correct scheduled layout at the right time. Reliable time sync is crucial. |
| **Advanced Transitions**     | More sophisticated visual transitions between content items (e.g., Ken Burns for images, 3D flips, custom shaders).   | Medium-High     | Custom Compose animations, potentially OpenGL or external animation libraries. Performance on various TV hardware.                            |
| **Interactive Content**      | Support for touch (if applicable TV) or D-Pad remote interaction with HTML content (e.g., simple polls, navigation within WebView). | Medium-High     | Careful WebView configuration, JavaScript-Kotlin bridge, focus handling within WebView, security implications.                                 |
| **Conditional Playback**     | Display content based on external data triggers (e.g., weather API, sales data API, time of day, sensor input).      | High            | Backend integration for data sources, logic in TV app to evaluate conditions and switch content. Real-time data fetching.                       |
| **Proof-of-Play Logs**       | Detailed logging of what content played, when, and for how long. Logs are sent to the backend for reporting/analytics. | Medium          | Reliable local logging, batching and sending logs to backend, backend storage and reporting interface. Offline log queueing.                  |
| **Real-time Device Commands**| From backend dashboard: force reboot device, take screenshot, clear cache, force app update, change device settings. | High            | Requires robust FCM command handling or persistent connection. Privileged operations (reboot, screenshot) often need MDM/root.              |
| **Device Grouping (Backend)**| Group devices in the Laravel backend to assign layouts or send commands to multiple screens at once.                  | Medium (Backend)| Backend UI/logic change. TV app is largely unaffected but benefits from easier management.                                            |
| **Video Wall Synchronization** | Synchronize content playback (especially video) across multiple devices to create a video wall effect.              | Very High       | Network time protocol (NTP) for precise time sync, P2P communication or central sync server, low-latency network, frame-accurate sync logic. |
| **Advanced Diagnostics**     | App sends detailed health metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, storage stats, network stats, ExoPlayer errors) to backend. | Medium          | Collecting metrics efficiently, backend ingestion and visualization.                                                                      |
| **Content Tagging & Filtering**| Tag content items and layouts. Allow devices to subscribe to tags, dynamically updating content.                     | Medium-High     | Backend tagging system, app logic to handle tag subscriptions and filter content.                                                               |
| **Emergency Alert Override** | Ability for backend to push an emergency message that immediately overrides current content on selected screens.      | Medium          | High-priority FCM message, special UI handling in the app to display alert prominently.                                                         |
| **Dynamic Text/Data Overlays**| Overlay dynamic text or data (e.g., time, date, custom messages, RSS feed snippets) on top of playing content.       | Medium          | Backend to define overlay content, Composable for rendering overlay, managing z-index and positioning.                                       |
| **App-Level Settings on TV** | A hidden or admin-accessible settings screen on the TV app itself for basic diagnostics or re-registration (dev only). | Low-Medium      | Leanback `GuidedStepSupportFragment` or custom Compose screen. Secure access.                                                                      |

**Prioritization Prompts:**
*   Which of these features would provide the most value to your target users or differentiate your product?
*   What is the technical feasibility and resource requirement for each?
*   Are there any dependencies between these features?

**Rule:** Always build upon a stable core. Ensure MVP functionality is robust before tackling complex "wow" features. Each new feature should align with the project vision.
