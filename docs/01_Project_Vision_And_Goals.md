# ðŸ§­ I. Project Vision & Goals

## Vision
To create a highly reliable, remotely manageable, and visually engaging Android TV digital signage application. The app will seamlessly pair with a Laravel backend, display dynamic content with smooth transitions, and operate autonomously with robust error handling and offline capabilities.

## Core Goals

1.  **Effortless Device Onboarding:** QR code-based registration for quick and easy setup.
    *   **Prompt:** How can we make the QR code scanning and registration process as intuitive as possible for non-technical users setting up the TV?
2.  **Dynamic Content Delivery:** Support for various media types (images, videos, HTML, carousels) managed via the Laravel backend.
    *   **Rule:** The app must gracefully handle different content types and their specific loading/rendering requirements.
3.  **Unattended Operation:** Designed for 24/7 uptime, auto-start on boot, and self-recovery from common issues (e.g., network loss, media playback errors).
    *   **Prompt:** What are the most common failure points for a 24/7 running app, and how will the app detect and recover from them?
4.  **Remote Management & Monitoring:** Ability to update content, check device status, and potentially diagnose issues remotely via the Laravel backend.
    *   **Rule:** All content and configuration changes must be driven by the backend. The TV app is a display client.
5.  **Exceptional User Experience:** Smooth playback, professional look and feel, and clear on-screen instructions, especially during setup.
    *   **Prompt:** What visual cues and animations can enhance the perceived performance and professionalism of the app?

## Target Scenarios

*   Retail displays in malls, supermarkets, and other retail spaces
*   Restaurant menu boards 
*   Educational institutions
*   Corporate communication screens 
*   Hotel information kiosks 
*   Event signage 
*   Public transport information displays 

**Developer Note:** Keep these goals and scenarios in mind during every stage of development. Every feature should contribute to achieving this vision.
