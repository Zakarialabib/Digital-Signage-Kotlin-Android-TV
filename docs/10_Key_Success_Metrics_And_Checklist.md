# ✅ 10. Key Success Metrics & Pre-Launch Checklist

This final document outlines key metrics to track the success of the digital signage app and a checklist to go through before any major launch or deployment.

## Key Success Metrics

These metrics will help gauge the app's performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.

*   **Device Uptime / Reliability:**
    *   **Metric:** Percentage of devices online and reporting heartbeats within the expected interval.
    *   **Source:** Backend monitoring of `last_seen_at` from heartbeats, Firebase Crashlytics (crash-free users/sessions).
*   **Content Playback Success Rate:**
    *   **Metric:** Percentage of content items played successfully versus attempted.
    *   **Source:** (Future Enhancement) Proof-of-Play logs, error reporting from device, Firebase Analytics for media load errors.
*   **Time to Onboard a New Device:**
    *   **Metric:** Average time taken from app first launch to successful registration and first content display.
    *   **Source:** Manual testing, analytics on registration flow completion.
*   **Content Update Propagation Time:**
    *   **Metric:** Time taken from a content change in the backend to it being reflected on the TV screen.
    *   **Source:** Backend logging of change + FCM send time, app logging of FCM receive + layout refresh time.
*   **App Performance:**
    *   **Metric:** Smoothness of playback (low jank), responsiveness of UI (if any interactive elements), app launch time.
    *   **Source:** Android Studio Profiler, Firebase Performance Monitoring (if integrated), manual observation.
*   **Resource Usage:**
    *   **Metric:** CPU, memory, network, and storage usage on devices.
    *   **Source:** Android Studio Profiler, (Future Enhancement) advanced diagnostics sent to backend.
*   **Admin User Satisfaction (Backend Focus, but impacts app perception):**
    *   **Metric:** Ease of managing devices and content via the Laravel backend.
    *   **Source:** Surveys, feedback from admin users.

## Pre-Launch Checklist

This checklist should be reviewed before deploying a new version to production or to a significant number of devices.
