## Project Description

Digital-Signage-Kotlin-Android-TV is an Android TV application designed to transform any standard Android TV device into a digital signage display. It allows you to showcase a curated list of images, videos, and web content on a continuous loop, ideal for advertising, informational displays, or internal communications. Built with Kotlin, it leverages the Android TV platform for a seamless and optimized viewing experience.

## Target Audience

This application is ideal for:

*   Businesses looking for cost-effective digital signage solutions.
*   Organizations needing to display information in public areas.
*   Individuals wanting to repurpose Android TV devices for personal displays.
*   Developers seeking a well-structured Kotlin-based Android TV project to learn from.

## Key Features

*   **Media Playback:** Supports a variety of image and video formats.
*   **Playlist Management:** Easily create and manage playlists of content to be displayed.
*   **Scheduling:** Schedule content to be displayed at specific times.
*   **Remote Management:** Control the display remotely via a web interface (Future Enhancement).
*   **Web Content Integration:** Display web pages and dynamic content using WebView.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive interface optimized for Android TV navigation.
*   **Offline Support:** Content can be cached for playback without an internet connection.
*   **Customizable Layouts:** Adapt the display to fit different screen sizes and orientations.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zakarialabib/Digital-Signage-Kotlin-Android-TV.git
    ```

2.  **Open the project in Android Studio.**

    *   Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.
    *   Import the cloned project into Android Studio.

3.  **Configure the project:**

    *   Update the `build.gradle` files with the necessary dependencies and configurations.
    *   Set the `applicationId` in the `build.gradle` file.

4.  **Build and run the app on an Android TV device or emulator.**

    *   Connect your Android TV device to your development machine.
    *   Build the APK in Android Studio (`Build > Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) > Build APK(s)`).
    *   Install the APK on your Android TV device using ADB (`adb install app-debug.apk`).
    *   Alternatively, run the app directly from Android Studio on a connected device or emulator.
